RSA implementation example.

Known bugs:
It could be the case that the message >= modulus. To avoid, use
a do-while loop to generate key until modulus happen to be exactly N bits.

It's possible that gcd(phi, publicKey) != 1 in which case
the key generation fails. This will only happen if phi is a
multiple of 65537. To avoid, use a do-while loop to generate
keys until the gcd is 1.
